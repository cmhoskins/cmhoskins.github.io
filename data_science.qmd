This page highlights skills I've learned by completing labs from **523 C: Environmental Data Science Applications for Water Resources** taught at Colorado State University by Mike Johnson, PhD.

## COVID Trends
```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Weighted Mean Center of the COVID-19 Outbreak"
knitr::include_graphics("media/weighted_means.png")
```

Through this lab, I developed skills in vector data analysis and visualization using COVID-19 data. I gained experience in data wrangling with `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, and `lubridate`; data visualization with `ggplot2` and `flextable`; and building and evaluating a linear model. I also used `sf` and `zoo` for spatial and temporal data analysis.

## Distances and Projections
```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Map of the Most Populous cities in Each State Within 100 Miles of the U.S. Border"
knitr::include_graphics("media/border-2.png")
```

In this lab, I continued to build on my vector data wrangling and visualization skills. I explored the structure and properties of sf, sfc, and sfg objects, and used the `sf` package to work with spatial data. I practiced transforming coordinate reference systems, calculating distances, and handling spatial geometries. Additionally, I expanded my data visualization techniques using `mapview` and `gglighlight`.

## Tessallations, Point-in-Polygon
```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Hydroelectric Dams across the USA with Hexagonal Grid Tessallation (above mean + 1 standard deviations)"
knitr::include_graphics("media/hydroelectric.png")
```

By completing this lab, I learned how to implement tessellations for spatial data analysis and learned about the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP). I used the `AOI` package to define an area of interest encompassing CONUS states. I then used Voronoi, triangulated, square grid, and hexagonal grid tessellations to examine the spatial distribution of US dams. I used point-in-polygon analysis and `rmapshaper` to simplify geometries, and wrote functions to streamline analysis and visualization. Adding to my data visualization skills, I created an interactive map using `leaflet` and used `kableExtra` to create a polished table.

## Rasters & Remote Sensing
```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Statellite imagery raster layers of 5 indices for Palo, Iowa during the flooding event on September 26, 2016"
knitr::include_graphics("media/indices.png")
```

In this lab, I practiced working with raster data by creating flood maps using satellite imagery from a flooding event along the Cedar and Wapsipinicon rivers. I used `terra` and `rstac` to access and process Landsat Collection 2 imagery, and then RGB composites for initial visualization. Using raster algebra, I calculated spectral indices, applied thresholds, and used the `stats` package to extract flood clusters. I then categorized flood extent and classified flood certainty.

## Machine Learning in Hydrology
```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig-cap: "Random Forest Model Using PET and Precipitation to Predict Streamflow"
knitr::include_graphics("media/model-pet.png")
```

Through this lab, I explored predictive modeling using the `tidymodels` framework and the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-samples Studies (CAMELS) dataset. I learned best practices for building reproducable models. I applied and compared four modeling techniques: linear regression, random forest, `xgboost` and neural networks using `baguette`. I evaluated model performance using RMSE, R-squared, and MAE, and visualized results using the `vip`and `workflows` packages.
