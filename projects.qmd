This final project for WR514: GIS and Data Analysis in Water Resources, taught by Josh Reyling, leverages ArcGIS to visualize cyanobacterial blooms in Pyramid Lake, NV. NDVI was calculated from Landsat 8-9 imagery for four bloom events, and a threshold of 0.25 was applied to identify areas of potential cyanobacterial activity. The slider app above displays a vectorized  representation of NDVI for blooms that occurred on 10/29/2017, 9/22/2021, 10/6/2023 and 10/8/2024.

This project examines the hydrology of the Trout Creek watershed, located on the southern side of Lake Tahoe, CA for water years 1960-2023. Using datasets from USGS and climateengine.org, water budged components such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent, and soil moisture were evaluated. The analysis compares pre- and post-restoration periods of the watershed, with results visualized using the R packages `ggplot2`, `tmap`, and `plotly`.
