During an internship with the Rossyndicate Lab at Colorado State University, I contributed to the development of a comprehensive database of water sources in U.S. National Parks. This project uses the database to assess the risk of saltwater intrusion to park water sources due to sea-level rise and changes in aquifer recharge.

This project uses ArcGIS to visualize cyanobacterial blooms in Pyramid Lake, NV. NDVI was calculated from Landsat 8-9 imagery for four bloom events, and a threshold of 0.25 was applied to identify areas of potential cyanobacterial activity. The slider app displays a vectorized representation of NDVI for blooms that occurred on 10/29/2017, 9/22/2021, 10/6/2023 and 10/8/2024.

This project examines the hydrology of the Trout Creek watershed, located on the southern side of Lake Tahoe, CA. Using datasets from USGS and climateengine.org, precipitation, evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent, and soil moisture were evaluated for water years 1960-2023. The analysis compares pre- and post-restoration periods of the watershed, with results visualized using the R packages `ggplot2`, `tmap`, and `plotly`.
