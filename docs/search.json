    "text": "Trout Creek was historically one of the most productive fisheries in the Tahoe Basin. In 1859, logging began in the Trout Creek Area. During the logging period, 13 miles of railroad, 16 miles of wagon haul roads, 2 miles of “V” flume and 28 logging camps were constructed in the Trout Creek watershed, causing erosion along Trout Creek and Saxton Creek (TRCD, 2013). Post-logging, the Trout Creek watershed was used to graze cattle and sheep. During this time, a ditch system and a series of small dams were developed along the tributaries of Trout Creek and Cold Creek (TRCD, 2013). Excessive grazing degraded watershed conditions. In 1996, the dams were removed from Cold Creek (California Tahoe Conservancy, 2022). Since 1996, projects within the Trout Creek watershed were conducted to restore the watershed to its historic condition. In 2021, the Caldor Fire burned areas within the Trout Creek Watershed, affecting the watershed’s streams (California Tahoe Conservancy, 2022). Moving forward, plans are being developed for restoration projects in several sections of Trout Creek and Cold Creek.  \nThis analysis compares flow and components of the water budget for the pre-restoration period before 1996 and the restoration period from 1996 onward."

    "text": "The Trout Creek Watershed is located on the southern side of Lake Tahoe, California, adjacent to the Nevada state border (Figure 1). The main water features include Saxton Creek, Cold Creek, Trout Creek and Heavenly Valley Creek. These features converge into the main channel of Trout Creek, which flows north before draining into Lake Tahoe. The drainage area above the stream gauge is 36.7 square miles (Table 1).\nThe highest elevation of Trout Creek Watershed Is 10878 feet and the minimum elevation at the stream gauge is 6261 feet. The mean slope of the watershed is 30.1%, with steep, mountainous terrain in the southern region that becomes flatter toward the northern part as it nears the lake. The largest listed land cover type in the area is forest, which covers 43.1% of the watershed (Table 1). Urban land covers 3.1%, and lakes and ponds cover less than 1% of the area. Other land cover types are not specified by Web Soil Survey. Soils in the watershed are dominantly composed of various types of sand, including loamy, cobbly, coarse, gravelly, and stony sands, along with combinations of these textures (Table 2). They are primarily classified as excessively well-drained.\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of the Trout Creek watershed.\n\n\nParameter Description\nValue\n\n\n\n\ndrainage area\n36.7 mi²\n\n\nmean basin slope computed from 30 m DEM\n30.1 %\n\n\nmean basin elevation\n7932 ft\n\n\nmaximum basin elevation\n10878 ft\n\n\nminimum basin elevation\n6261 ft\n\n\narea covered by forest\n43.1 %\n\n\narea covered by lakes and ponds\n0.08881 %\n\n\narea of developed (urban) land\n3.1 %\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Characteristics of major soil types of the Trout Creek watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil Series\nPrimary Texture\nDrainage Class\nKsat\n\n\n\n\nCassenai\ngravelly loamy coarse sand, cobbly loamy coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand\nsomewhat excessively drained\nhigh\n(1.98 to 5.95 in/hr)\n\n\nTemo-Witefels complex\ngravelly loamy coarse sand\nexcessively drained/ somewhat excessively drained\nmoderately low to moderately high\n(0.01 to 1.42 in/hr)\n\n\nDagget\nvery gravelly loamy coarse sand\nexcessively drained\nmoderately low to moderately high\n(0.01 to 1.42 in/hr)\n\n\nWhitell-Jobsis-Rock outcrop complex\nvery cobbly loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, extremely stony loamy coarse sand\nsomewhat excessively drained\nmoderately low to moderately high\n(0.01 to 1.42 in/hr)"

Mean annual evapotranspiration increased from 1083.18 mm pre-restoration to 1153.28 mm post-restoration. In contrast, both mean annual snow water equivalent and soil moisture decreased from the pre-restoration to the restoration group. Snow water equivalent dropped from 311.69 mm to 297.45 mm, and soil moisture dropped from 50.04 mm to 48.83 mm.

In 1983, the watershed recorded the highest annual average soil moisture (54.59 mm) and the lowest annual average evapotranspiration (941.37 mm). In 2017, the watershed experienced the highest recorded annual discharge (1052.80 mm) and precipitation (1888.09 mm). In 2021, the watershed recorded the lowest annual soil moisture (42.91 mm) and the highest annual evapotranspiration (1250.37 mm). The Caldor Fire occurred during water years 2021 and 2022. Specifically, the Caldor Fire started on 8/14/2021 and was fully contained on 10/25/2021. Rain and snowmelt inputs were low from June to September of 2021, causing soil moisture to decline during that period (Figure 7). A precipitation event in mid-October of 2021 increased soil moisture and coincided with the containment of the fire.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculate monthly mean for P, Q, ET, SWE, and SM.

Snow accumulates during winter, with snowmelt typically occurring between April and July. Soil moisture decreases during the spring and summer months, continuing through August and September, before increasing with higher precipitation in winter.

    "text": "The restoration period shows increased variability in discharge compared to the pre-restoration period. This change appears to correlate more strongly with variations in precipitation than with the restoration efforts. Seasonal and annual trends suggest that precipitation and snowpack strongly influence streamflow. The observed increases in average precipitation, discharge and reference evapotranspiration, coupled with decreases in snow water equivalent and soil moisture suggest that climate variability may be driving hydrologic changes in the watershed. The most prominent trends from water years 1981 through 2023 are the consistent decrease in soil moisture and the increase in reference evapotranspiration, indicating increasing aridity in the watershed. Additionally, greater climatic variability is observed during the restoration period, with both higher and lower precipitation values, which contribute to increased fluctuations in snow water equivalent and discharge. These patterns may be influenced by more dramatic climate-driven weather patterns, which may amplify seasonal and annual variability in hydraulic conditions of Trout Creek watershed. Record high annual evapotranspiration and low soil moisture correlate to the Caldor fire, which burned through parts of the watershed in 2021."

    "text": "Introduction\nTrout Creek was historically one of the most productive fisheries in the Tahoe Basin. In 1859, logging began in the Trout Creek Area. During the logging period, 13 miles of railroad, 16 miles of wagon haul roads, 2 miles of “V” flume and 28 logging camps were constructed in the Trout Creek watershed, causing erosion along Trout Creek and Saxton Creek (TRCD, 2013). Post-logging, the Trout Creek watershed was used to graze cattle and sheep. During this time, a ditch system and a series of small dams were developed along the tributaries of Trout Creek and Cold Creek (TRCD, 2013). Excessive grazing degraded watershed conditions. In 1996, the dams were removed from Cold Creek (California Tahoe Conservancy, 2022). Since 1996, projects within the Trout Creek watershed were conducted to restore the watershed to its historic condition. In 2021, the Caldor Fire burned areas within the Trout Creek Watershed, affecting the watershed’s streams (California Tahoe Conservancy, 2022). Moving forward, plans are being developed for restoration projects in several sections of Trout Creek and Cold Creek.  \nThis analysis compares flow and components of the water budget for the pre-restoration period before 1996 and the restoration period from 1996 onward."

    "text": "Watershed Characteristics\nThe Trout Creek Watershed is located on the southern side of Lake Tahoe, California, adjacent to the Nevada state border (Figure 1). The main water features include Saxton Creek, Cold Creek, Trout Creek and Heavenly Valley Creek. These features converge into the main channel of Trout Creek, which flows north before draining into Lake Tahoe. The drainage area above the stream gauge is 36.7 square miles (Table 1).\nThe highest elevation of Trout Creek Watershed Is 10878 feet and the minimum elevation at the stream gauge is 6261 feet. The mean slope of the watershed is 30.1%, with steep, mountainous terrain in the southern region that becomes flatter toward the northern part as it nears the lake. The largest listed land cover type in the area is forest, which covers 43.1% of the watershed (Table 1). Urban land covers 3.1%, and lakes and ponds cover less than 1% of the area. Other land cover types are not specified by Web Soil Survey. Soils in the watershed are dominantly composed of various types of sand, including loamy, cobbly, coarse, gravelly, and stony sands, along with combinations of these textures (Table 2). They are primarily classified as excessively well-drained.\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of the Trout Creek watershed.\n\n\nParameter Description\nValue\n\n\n\n\ndrainage area\n36.7 mi²\n\n\nmean basin slope computed from 30 m DEM\n30.1 %\n\n\nmean basin elevation\n7932 ft\n\n\nmaximum basin elevation\n10878 ft\n\n\nminimum basin elevation\n6261 ft\n\n\narea covered by forest\n43.1 %\n\n\narea covered by lakes and ponds\n0.08881 %\n\n\narea of developed (urban) land\n3.1 %\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Characteristics of major soil types of the Trout Creek watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil Series\nPrimary Texture\nDrainage Class\nKsat\n\n\n\n\nCassenai\ngravelly loamy coarse sand, cobbly loamy coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand\nsomewhat excessively drained\nhigh\n(1.98 to 5.95 in/hr)\n\n\nTemo-Witefels complex\ngravelly loamy coarse sand\nexcessively drained/ somewhat excessively drained\nmoderately low to moderately high\n(0.01 to 1.42 in/hr)\n\n\nDagget\nvery gravelly loamy coarse sand\nexcessively drained\nmoderately low to moderately high\n(0.01 to 1.42 in/hr)\n\n\nWhitell-Jobsis-Rock outcrop complex\nvery cobbly loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, extremely stony loamy coarse sand\nsomewhat excessively drained\nmoderately low to moderately high\n(0.01 to 1.42 in/hr)"

Discharge exceedance probability (p) shows slightly higher low and high flows in the restoration group compared to the pre-restoration group (Figures 3 & 4).\nThe watershed is semi-arid with an average annual precipitation of 895.91 mm and an aridity index (P/ET) of 0.79. The runoff ratio (Q/P) is 0.39, meaning that over half of precipitation does not become runoff.

Mean annual discharge also increased slightly from 337.80 mm pre-restoration to 357.09 mm post-restoration. Mean annual evapotranspiration increased from 1083.18 mm pre-restoration to 1153.28 mm post-restoration. In contrast, both mean annual snow water equivalent and soil moisture decreased from the pre-restoration to the restoration group. Snow water equivalent dropped from 311.69 mm to 297.45 mm, and soil moisture dropped from 50.04 mm to 48.83 mm. Annual trends show that evapotranspiration increased, while soil moisture decreased from 1981 to 2023 (Figure 5).\n\n\nCode\n# Read CSV files for P, ET, SM, and SWE:\nP_TC &lt;- read.csv('data/TC_Precip_Gridmet.csv')\nET_TC &lt;- read.csv('data/TC_ET_Gridmet.csv')\nSM_TC &lt;- read.csv('data/TC_SM_10_40_Wildas.csv')\nSWE_TC &lt;- read.csv('data/TC_SWE_Wildas.csv')\n\n# Filter Q_1981 based on the year range\nQ_1981 &lt;- trout_creek %&gt;%\n  filter(wyear &gt;= 1981 & wyear &lt;= 2023)\n\n# Convert Date Format\nP_TC$Date = mdy(P_TC$Date)\n\n# Join P_TC with Q_1981\nP_TC &lt;- P_TC %&gt;%\n  left_join(Q_1981 %&gt;% select(Date, Q_mm, wyear), by = \"Date\")\n\n# Bind Other Variables\nP_TC$ET_mm = ET_TC$ET_mm\nP_TC$SM_mm = SM_TC$SM_mm\nP_TC$SWE_mm = SWE_TC$SWE_mm\n\n#Separate Pre-restoration and Restoration Periods\nTC_climate &lt;- P_TC %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    group = case_when(\n      wyear &lt; 1996 ~ \"pre-restoration\",\n      wyear &gt;= 1996 ~ \"restoration\"))\n\n\n#Calculate Annual Trends\nclimate_annual &lt;- suppressMessages(TC_climate %&gt;%\n  group_by(wyear,group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(P_mm=sum(P_mm),\n            Q_mm=sum(Q_mm),\n            ET_mm=sum(ET_mm),\n            peakSWE=max(SWE_mm),\n            meanSM=mean(SM_mm),\n            ))\n\n#Plot Annual Sum Q\nQ_1981 &lt;- Q_annual %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=wyear,y=Q_mm,color=group)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Water Year\", y = \"Q (mm)\", color = \"Group\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n#Plot Annual Sum P\nP &lt;- climate_annual %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=wyear,y=P_mm,color=group)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Water Year\", y = \"P (mm)\", color = \"Group\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n#Plot Annual Sum ET\nET &lt;- climate_annual %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=wyear,y=ET_mm,color=group)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Water Year\", y = \"ET (mm)\", color = \"Group\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n#Plot Annual Peak SWE\nSWE &lt;- climate_annual %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=wyear,y=peakSWE,color=group)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Water Year\", y = \"SWE (mm)\", color = \"Group\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n#Plot Annual Mean SM\nSM &lt;- climate_annual %&gt;%\n  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=wyear,y=meanSM,color=group)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Water Year\", y = \"SM (mm)\", color = \"Group\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\nggarrange(P,ET,SWE,SM,Q_1981, ncol=2,nrow=3, common.legend = TRUE, legend = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Annual sum for precipitation(P), grass reference evapotranspiration(ET), and discharge (Q).

In 1983, the watershed recorded the highest annual average soil moisture (54.59 mm) and the lowest annual average evapotranspiration (941.37 mm). In 2017, the watershed experienced the highest recorded annual discharge (1052.80 mm) and precipitation (1888.09 mm). In 2021, the watershed recorded the lowest annual soil moisture (42.91 mm) and the highest annual evapotranspiration (1250.37 mm). The Caldor Fire occurred during water years 2021 and 2022. Specifically, the Caldor Fire started on 8/14/2021 and was fully contained on 10/25/2021. Rain and snowmelt inputs were low from June to September of 2021, causing soil moisture to decline during that period (Figure 7). A precipitation event in mid-October of 2021 increased soil moisture and coincided with the containment of the fire.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculate monthly mean for P, Q, ET, SWE, and SM.

    "text": "Conclusions\nThe restoration period shows increased variability in discharge compared to the pre-restoration period. This change appears to correlate more strongly with variations in precipitation than with the restoration efforts. Seasonal and annual trends suggest that precipitation and snowpack strongly influence streamflow. The observed increases in average precipitation, discharge and reference evapotranspiration, coupled with decreases in snow water equivalent and soil moisture suggest that climate variability may be driving hydrologic changes in the watershed. The most prominent trends from water years 1981 through 2023 are the consistent decrease in soil moisture and the increase in reference evapotranspiration, indicating increasing aridity in the watershed. Additionally, greater climatic variability is observed during the restoration period, with both higher and lower precipitation values, which contribute to increased fluctuations in snow water equivalent and discharge. These patterns may be influenced by more dramatic climate-driven weather patterns, which may amplify seasonal and annual variability in hydraulic conditions of Trout Creek watershed. Record high annual evapotranspiration and low soil moisture correlate to the Caldor fire, which burned through parts of the watershed in 2021."
