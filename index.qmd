I’m a graduate student in the Ecosystem Science and Sustainability program at Colorado State University, focusing on water resources and data science. Earlier in my career, I led conservation field crews in Nevada and California, restoring ecosystems impacted by terrestrial and aquatic invasive species. Researching water quality and aquatic plants inspired me to learn more about sustainable management of water resources. In graduate school, I’ve worked to develop specialized knowledge in hydrology, water law, and water resources planning while building skills in geospatial analysis and data science. I’m interested in applying data and models to drive sustainable management decisions.
