I am an aspiring ecosystem scientist specializing in data analytics, GIS, and water resources management. I earned my graduate degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability from Colorado State University, where I developed expertise in hydrology, water law, geospatial analysis, and environmental data science.

I have a background leading natural resources field teams across Nevada and California, collecting and managing data to support ecosystem assessment and restoration projects. I am seeking to build a career where I can apply both field experience and analytical skills to support informed ecosystem management decisions.
