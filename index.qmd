Hi! I am Colleen, a graduate student studying water resources at Colorado State University. I am passionate about water sustainability and ecosystem conservation. On this site, you'll find a watershed analysis of Trout Creek Watershed in Lake Tahoe, CA. This project highlights my interests in R coding, hydraulic analysis, and data visualization.
