I am interested in protecting ecosystems and conserving natural resources. I earned my graduate degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability from Colorado State University, where I focused on water resources management, geospatial analytics and environmental data science. I have a background leading natural resources field teams across Nevada and California, collecting and managing environmental data to support ecosystem assessment and restoration projects. My work leverages field experience and targeted analytical approaches to develop sustainable management solutions.
