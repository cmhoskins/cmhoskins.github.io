Iâ€™m a graduate student at Colorado State University studying water resources and data analysis. I work for the [ROSSyndicate](https://rossyndicate.com/) managing a database of water sources across U.S. National Parks. I spend my days investigating, mapping, and compiling records of surface and groundwater sources available to park visitors and staff. Before attending CSU, I worked in environmental conservation, where I led field crews, conducted ecosystem monitoring, and researched methods to prevent the spread of [aquatic invasive weeds](https://tahoekeysweeds.org/). I am interested in using data science to support water resources research and management.
